I recently graduated with a PhD from School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh where I was advised by Dr. Alexandra Birch and Prof. Mark Steedman. 
My research interests lie in the field of Natural Language Processing. I broadly work on dialogue, multilinguality, and evaluation. My recent works look at personalisation and MT evaluation abilities of LLMs. 
Previously, I completed MS (by Research) from Indian Institute of Technology Madras 
where I was jointly advised by Prof. Balaraman Ravindran and Dr. Mitesh M. Khapra. 

I have interned at Microsoft (Redmond, Bengaluru), PolyAI (London), and worked for a year at Robert Bosch Centre for Data Science and AI resulting in a collective research experience of 7 years across academia, big-tech, and start-ups.
