I am a PhD student at CDT in NLP, School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh advised by Dr. Alexandra Birch and Prof. Mark Steedman. My research interests lie in the field of Natural Language Processing. I am associated with the STATMT group. I will be exploring the area of multilingual dialogue systems.

Previously, I completed MS (by Research) from Indian Institute of Technology Madras 
where I was jointly advised by Prof. Balaraman Ravindran and Dr. Mitesh M. Khapra. My thesis involved incorporating information from unstructured data to improve dialogue systems. I was also associated with RBC-DSAI.
